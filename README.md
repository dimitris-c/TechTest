# Architecture

The app is made using the MVVM-C (slighty altered) pattern, for persistence I used Realm to save the network data.
The app has Unit Tests for most of the classes, due to the timeframe of the code test some classes where not tested, but most the classes are highly testable.

### Libraries

- Realm (for persistence)

Thank you for the opportunity and I do hope we have a chat to discuss my approach and hear your feedback.
